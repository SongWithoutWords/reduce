would it be better to have a different symbol for definition than assignment?


e.g.

x = 1
vs
x <- 1

or
$ x = 1
vs
x = 1

what are the advantages of the $ syntax?

it provides a uniform way to specify mutability that is shared with the parameter syntax

i.e.

inc(^~Int x) => x = x + 1

~$ x = 0

inc(~x)


what's better,
inc(^~Int x) => x = x + 1

or

inc(^~Int x) => x <- x + 1

or

inc(^~Int x) = x <- x + 1


myArray(myIndex) = myValue

or

myArray(myIndex) <- myValue

<-[T](Array[T] a, ^T t)

~$ x = 0
x <- x + 1

or

~$ x = 0
x = x + 1
