# ripl
A Robust and Intuitive Programming Language, and work in progress, written in Scala with an LLVM back-end.

## Planned Features
- [x] Compiled
- [x] Strong, static typing
- [x] Strict evaluation
- [ ] Type-safe discriminated unions and functional idioms
- [x] Mutable data structures to support computationally intensive tasks
- [ ] Type-level constraints on the mutability of data and purity of functions
- [x] Ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading) to promote programmer sanity
- [ ] Parametric polymorphism (templates/generics) to abstract over types and perform type-level programming
- [x] A readable, uniform syntax that is suitable for metaprogramming, inspired by [Readable Lisp S-expressions](https://sourceforge.net/p/readable/wiki/Home/)
