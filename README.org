* ripl
A Robust and Intuitive Programming Language, and work in progress, written in Scala with an LLVM back-end.

** Planned Features
  - Compiled
  - Strong, static typing
  - Type inference
  - Strict evaluation
  - Type-safe discriminated unions
  - Pattern matching
  - Mutable data structures to support computationally intensive tasks
  - Type-level constraints on the mutability of data and purity of functions
  - Ad-hoc polymorphism (overloading) to promote programmer sanity
  - Parametric polymorphism (templates/generics) to abstract over types and perform type-level programming
  - A readable, uniform syntax that is suitable for metaprogramming, inspired by [Readable Lisp S-expressions](https://sourceforge.net/p/readable/wiki/Home/)
